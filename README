RUNCOF
Runoff coefficient calculation.

runcof is a command line tool to calculate the runoff coefficient for
watersheds that have different land use and soil type using the methodology
from Mexican Norm NOM-011-CONAGUA-2015. The watershed is divided in homogenous
zones to get a coefficient of each one.

This program is available in English and Spanish.

REQUIREMENTS

To use the command line tool from source code:

-Python >= 2.7

INSTALL

This script does not require to be installed, you can use it directly from
source code (see requirements above) or use the Windows executable.

USAGE

runcof is a command line tool, to run it open a Terminal or System Prompt and
go to the directory where the files are located, then execute the command:

> runcof.exe --help

or from source code:

> python runcof.py --help

There are required options to calculate the runoff coefficient:

 -a : to input a blank space delimited list of areas in hectares
 -l : to input a blank space delimited list of land uses (see help)
 -s : to input a blank space delimited list of soil types (see help)
 -p : to input the precipitation in millimiters

EXAMPLE

To calculate the runoff coefficient of a watershed divided in three different
areas with different soil type and land use, execute the command:

> runcof.exe -a 10 20 30 -l 13 7 8 -s 0 1 0 -p 800

The first 10 hectares are grassland (13) with permeable soil (0), the next 20
hectares are Forest at 75% coverage (7) with medium premeability, and the
final 30 hectares are forest at 50% coverage (8) with a permeable soil (0).
The watershed has an annual precipitation of 800 mm.
